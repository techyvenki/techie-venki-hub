###### Benefits of these Techniques

- **Improved Relevance**: Query rewriting helps in retrieving more specific and relevant information.
- **Better Context**: Step-back prompting allows for retrieval of broader context and background information.
- **Comprehensive Results**: Sub-query decomposition enables retrieval of information that covers different aspects of a complex query.
- **Flexibility**: Each technique can be used independently or in combination, depending on the specific use case.

-----

##### 5. Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE)

Traditional retrieval methods often face challenges in bridging the semantic gap between brief queries and longer, more detailed documents. Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE) tackles this issue by transforming the query into a full hypothetical document, improving retrieval relevance by aligning the query's representation more closely with document representations in the vector space.

###### Key Components

- **PDF Processing and Text Chunking**: Efficiently processes documents by extracting and segmenting text into manageable chunks for analysis.

#### Context and Content Enrichment

##### 6. Contextual Chunk Headers (CCH)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle with insufficient context within individual chunks, leading to retrieval errors or hallucinations during the response generation process. Contextual Chunk Headers (CCH) address this by augmenting chunks with higher-level context, ensuring better retrieval accuracy and comprehension by the language model.

###### Problems Addressed by CCH

- **Implicit References**: Chunks may refer to their subject using pronouns or vague references, making them difficult to retrieve or interpret accurately.
- **Context Dependency**: Many chunks lack standalone meaning and can only be properly understood within the broader context of the section or document, leading to potential misinterpretation.

###### Key Components

- **Contextual Chunk Headers**: This method enhances chunks by prepending them with headers that encapsulate higher-level context. These headers might include:
  - The document title.
  - A concise summary of the document.
  - The hierarchical structure of section and sub-section titles.

###### Benefits of CCH

- **Improved Context Representation**: Provides a more complete representation of the content and meaning of the text.

-----

##### 7. Relevant Segment Extraction (RSE)

When chunking documents for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), determining the optimal chunk size involves balancing tradeoffs. Larger chunks offer better context for the language model but can make precise retrieval more difficult, while smaller chunks enable precise retrieval but may lack sufficient context. Relevant Segment Extraction (RSE) provides a dynamic approach to address these challenges by reconstructing multi-chunk segments of contiguous text from retrieved chunks, ensuring the appropriate context is presented to the language model.

###### Challenges in Chunking

- **Context vs. Precision**: Large chunks are ideal for complex or high-level queries but may retrieve irrelevant information. Small chunks are precise but lack the broader context needed for more nuanced queries.
- **Query Diversity**: Real-world RAG use cases often involve a mix of queries, from simple fact-based questions to complex, multi-faceted inquiries that require extensive context.

###### Key Components

- **Chunk Text Key-Value Store**: RSE relies on a database to quickly retrieve chunk text using a `doc_id` and `chunk_index` as keys. This ensures that even chunks not initially marked as relevant can be included if they are sandwiched between highly relevant chunks.
- **Segment Reconstruction**: Rebuilds segments of contiguous text from nearby chunks, preserving their order in the original document. This step enhances the context provided to the language model.
