# Cloud Native Technologies Overview

Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds.

## Key Concepts

### Container-Based
- Applications are packaged as containers
- Consistent environment across development and production
- Isolation and resource efficiency

### Microservices Architecture
- Services are loosely coupled
- Independently deployable
- Language and technology agnostic

### DevOps Practices
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Infrastructure as Code
- Automated testing and deployment

### Dynamic Orchestration
- Automated container scheduling
- Scaling and load balancing
- Self-healing capabilities

## Benefits

1. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling
   - Auto-scaling capabilities
   - Resource optimization

2. **Resilience**
   - Distributed systems
   - Fault tolerance
   - High availability

3. **Agility**
   - Rapid deployment
   - Quick iterations
   - Fast time to market

4. **Observability**
   - Comprehensive monitoring
   - Distributed tracing
   - Centralized logging
