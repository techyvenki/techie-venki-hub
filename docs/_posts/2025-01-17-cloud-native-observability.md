### 2. Logging
- ELK Stack
- Loki
- Fluentd
- Log aggregation

### 3. Tracing
- Jaeger

- Storage utilization

### 2. Application Monitoring
- Golden signals
- Error rates
- Latency tracking
- Throughput analysis

### 3. User Experience Monitoring
- Frontend performance
- API latency
- Error tracking
- User journey analysis

## Analysis Tools

- Grafana dashboards
- Kibana
- Custom visualization
- Real-time analytics

### 2. Alerting
- Alert rules
- Notification channels
- On-call management
- Incident response

### 3. Troubleshooting
