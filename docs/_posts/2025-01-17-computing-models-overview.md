# Modern Computing Models

An exploration of contemporary computing paradigms that are shaping the future of technology and business.

## Evolution of Computing

### 1. Traditional Computing
- On-premises data centers
- Physical hardware management
- Manual scaling
- Capital-intensive

### 2. Modern Computing
- Cloud-based solutions
- Virtualization
- Automated scaling
- Pay-as-you-go model

## Key Computing Paradigms

### 1. Cloud Computing
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Global accessibility

### 2. Edge Computing
- Distributed processing
- Low latency
- Local data processing
- IoT integration

### 3. Serverless Computing
- Function as a Service (FaaS)
- Event-driven architecture
- Auto-scaling
- Pay-per-execution

## Choosing the Right Model

### Factors to Consider
1. **Performance Requirements**
   - Latency sensitivity
   - Processing power
   - Data throughput

2. **Cost Considerations**
   - Operating expenses
   - Capital expenses
   - Scaling costs

3. **Security and Compliance**
   - Data sovereignty
   - Regulatory requirements
   - Security controls

4. **Operational Complexity**
   - Management overhead
   - Technical expertise
   - Maintenance requirements
