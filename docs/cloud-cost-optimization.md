## Introduction

Cloud computing has revolutionized how we deploy and manage applications, but with this flexibility comes the challenge of managing costs effectively. In this post, I'll explore an innovative approach to cloud cost optimization using graph theory and mathematical modeling. We'll look at how representing cloud resources as a graph can help make smarter decisions about resource allocation and cost management.

## Core Concepts

### What Are We Trying to Solve?

The primary challenges in cloud cost optimization include:
- Balancing resource utilization and costs
- Managing data transfer costs between regions
- Optimizing storage and compute resource placement
- Handling dynamic workload requirements
- Dealing with multi-cloud environments
