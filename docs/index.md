# About Me
As an accomplished Application Architect with 12+ years of experience, I specialize in designing and implementing cutting-edge Generative AI solutions. My expertise spans the full technology stack, from front-end development (React, Angular) and robust back-end engineering (Java, Spring Boot, Node.js, npm) to cloud-native architectures on AWS and GCP (built from scratch using Terraform). I excel at translating complex business requirements into scalable and secure solutions, leveraging the latest advancements in AI/ML and cloud computing.

My background includes leading the delivery and modernization of enterprise-level applications, with a focus on cloud-native principles and emerging technologies. I've spearheaded initiatives incorporating IoT, IIoT, edge computing, and blockchain, crafting bespoke solutions that address unique business challenges. This includes building and deploying operational platforms for real-time event detection and response at scale, enabling solutions for predictive maintenance, quality control, and accurate failure diagnosis, ultimately driving significant operational efficiency improvements.

Furthermore, I'm passionate about creating sustainable data platforms that empower organizations to adopt data-driven practices. My experience includes strategically optimizing data storage and computation resources for proximity to data sources, ensuring performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.
